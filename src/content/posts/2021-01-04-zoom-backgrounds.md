With Working from Home being the new norm at home; I've started to ensure that I have a virtual background. It might be because my office is also my tool room, my dog's feeding, room, or my camping gear storage room; Or it might be because I never know if something crazy will happen in the window behind me.

A few Scenarios

* The Team Meeting\
  I choose a background that reflects me. That's either Jay Leno's garage or a Malibu boat (thanks to their pr team for sending these out in March).
* The somewhat professional\
  A stage house that helps me feel like maybe I'm more organized than I am and live in an ideal house (with seemingly no personal belongings)
* Very Pro\
