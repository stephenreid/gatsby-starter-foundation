description: 2021 Environmental Review and Goals.
---
Last year, one of my friends (who volunteered to build houses with me in Thailand) challenged me to think about environmental impact goals.

A couple were

1. Find something to do with my coffee grounds\
   \
   This was troublesome, first I looked into CompostNow, which some of my neighbors are doing, but not enough to likely make the pickup worth it -- and it's $25 a month; which, while not expensive, buy the a significant amount of Carbon Offsets\
   \
   In Q3, I finally found a solution. I converted a 1 gallon container for my Orgain Protein Powder into a Bokashi Bin. I'm now putting egg shells, coffee, small paper things, and more into this.... And then delivering it in 2 weeks to my Parents who have an active garden each year (and it could always use fresh soil)
2. Amazon Slow Shipping\
   \
   I did this for most of the year, and it was easy and worth it in digital credits too. This was also probably the right thing to do during a pandemic when some people need more faster.\
   \
   In addition to this, I built up some subscribe and saves
3. Eat Vegetarian More Often\
   \
   I over achieved on this; between weight goals, quarantine readiness, and working from home all of the time (so lunches were less exciting). My partner even started on this too.  It's not always including dinner, but often is multiple times a week.\
   \
   Between buying Orgain mix in bulk and buying frozen fruit, this is a pretty low bar.
4. Recycling my polystyrene egg cartons (and plastic and paper bags) more intentionally, by taking these back to Publix for pre-sorted recycling.

In addition, I helped my mom set up a worm bin composter.\
\
I started with Arcadia Power premium, going 100% wind with my power, but this got expensive fast -- and I think that either donating or leasing from a solar farm will do me better.\
\
In February, I saw an advertisement for[ Terracycle, raising a round on start engine](https://www.startengine.com/terracycle); Their beach plastics recycling program is the most attractive to me, but reading some of their stories is amazing. I see this as an investment that will payoff financially and for the environment.

Another thing in Q4 was that we started doing HelloFresh which to start off, offsets their carbon, but also reduces food waste with exact amounts, and a few vegetarian options.  I'm pretty good at otherwise using food waste, but it is an exciting way to cook more at home and cook with less environmental impact.\
\
To continue in 2021, I'm 

1.  Taking the vegetarian smoothie effort further, I should be able to commit to this more than one lunch a week; almost 4 days a week.
2. Much more Bokashi. I now have 2 reused 1 gallon buckets, and I think that it really helps the compost tumbler and garden.
3. I'd like to volunteer at one of our local recycling centers (Atlanta Thrive, Sandy Springs Recycling) as the world starts returning to normal. In December, when we had some extra large boxes, I actually took a load of cardboard (and cardboard that was destined for trash at my Condo). \

   Another option, that I feel will be most helpful is working at the Atlanta Community Food Bank Food Reclamation center (where they sort expiring food that comes from Kroger or Walmart)
